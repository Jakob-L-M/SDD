# Folder for pictures

To use this repo with your own pictures one can place all files in this folder (tested for .png and .jpg files) and run the `process_all.py` script in `/calculation/`.

For single pictures use `sdd.py` and pass the path as an argument.

Both scripts will create an output folder of the same name as the input file. The folder contains all data needed for the visualization.
