# SDD Image Processing

I was inspired by a recent lecture I took at Uni. In said lecture we discussed different matrix decompositions. This repo will be used to visualize semi-discread matrix decompositions (SDD) on images and provide a visual idea of the compression as well as concreate compression rates.

Look the result using some example pictures on my [website](https://jakob.)
